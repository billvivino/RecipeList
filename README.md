### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I tried to prioritize cleanly separating my code (MVVM, Dependency Injection), which helped make mocking and testing easier.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent roughly 3-4 hours on this project. I allocated time in segments by building the API service, parsing the JSON, getting the UI to respond, working on caching, and writing test cases.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I am not sure. My caching service takes in the image URL. More time could be spent separating the image download from the image caching.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I am not exceptionally skilled at writing test cases. However, I am sure there are more ways to test the app using the automated test structure.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I would appreciate any feedback you have on my caching and test cases. I am still learning how to do this well.
